The GVC Builder Kit gets you from idea to live project in minutes. No coding experience needed. The GVC brand and assets are baked in, Claude knows all of the design rules by heart, and setup is as simple as sending one command. From there, you can customize your project endlessly.

---

## Want to skip the setup? Start here.

Not ready to open a terminal? No problem at all.

Use the **[Web Builder](https://web-seven-tan-85.vercel.app)** to plan your project visually. Pick your template, describe your idea, choose power-ups, and see everything come together on screen. When you're ready to build it for real, it gives you the exact command to run.

This is the easiest way to get started, especially if you've never used a terminal before.

---

## What You'll Need

Before you start, here's what you need. That's it.

- **A computer.** Mac or Windows both work.
- **About 10 minutes.** That's all the setup takes.
- **No coding experience.** Seriously. You'll be guided through every step.

---

## Getting Started

This section walks you through everything from scratch. If you've never opened a terminal before, you're in the right place. We'll tell you exactly what to type at every step.

### Step 1: Open your terminal

A terminal is an app on your computer where you type commands. It looks like a text window with a blinking cursor. You type a command, press Enter, and the computer does something. That's all there is to it.

**If you're on a Mac:**
Open the Terminal app. You can find it by pressing Cmd+Space to open Spotlight search, then typing "Terminal" and pressing Enter.

**If you're on Windows:**
Open Command Prompt. Press the Windows key on your keyboard and type "cmd", then press Enter.

You should see a window with a blinking cursor. This is where you'll type commands to create and run your project. Don't worry. We'll tell you exactly what to type every step of the way.

### Step 2: Install Node.js

Node.js is what makes your project run on your computer. Think of it like an engine for your website. Without it, the project can't start. You only need to install it once.

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) in your browser
2. Click the big green button that says **LTS** (this is the stable version)
3. Open the file you downloaded and follow the installer steps. Just click "Next" or "Continue" until it's done.
4. Once it's installed, go back to your terminal and type `node -v` then press Enter. You should see a version number like `v20.11.0`. If you do, you're all set.

### Step 3: Install Claude

Claude is your AI building partner. It reads the brand guide in your project and helps you customize everything without writing code yourself. You just tell it what you want in plain English, and it does the work.

There are two ways to get Claude:

**Option A: Claude for Desktop (easiest)**
Go to [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) and install the desktop app, just like installing any other app.

**Option B: Claude Code in your terminal**
If you want to use Claude right from your terminal, type this command and press Enter:

```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Either option works. Pick whichever feels more comfortable.

### Step 4: Create your project

This is the fun part. Copy the command below, paste it into your terminal, and press Enter. The Builder Kit will ask you a few questions about what you want to build.

```
npx create-gvc-app
```

Here's what it looks like:

```
? What's your project called? my-gvc-tracker

? What do you want to build?
    Blank canvas - you describe the vibe, Claude builds it
  * A website or landing page
    A dashboard or tracker
    A game
    A gallery
    A voting or ranking page
    A lookup tool
    A card or image maker
    A profile page

? Describe your idea in a sentence or two:
  > A dashboard that shows which GVCs are listed
    under 0.5 ETH and tracks who's been sweeping
```

You describe what you want. The Builder Kit figures out the rest.

### Step 5: Start building

Now let's get your project running so you can see it. Type these two commands in your terminal, one at a time, pressing Enter after each:

```
cd my-gvc-tracker
npm run dev
```

The first command moves you into your project folder. The second command starts your project on your computer so you can see it in your browser.

Once it's running, open your web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

What is localhost:3000? It just means "your project, running on your own computer." It's not on the internet yet. Only you can see it. This is where you preview your work as you build.

### Step 6: Customize with Claude

Open your project folder in Claude and start telling it what you want. Your project already includes a brand guide so Claude knows the GVC style.

You don't need to know any programming. Just tell Claude what you want in plain English. Talk to it like you'd talk to a designer or a friend who knows how to code.

Try things like:

> "Add a hero section with a big gold title that says Welcome to my Tracker"

> "Show the current GVC floor price in a glowing stats card"

> "Add a leaderboard that shows the top 10 sweepers"

> "Make the background darker and add some floating gold particles"

Claude will keep everything on-brand automatically.

### Step 7: Ship it

When you're ready to go live, deploy your project to Vercel. It's free and takes about two minutes.

1. Push your project to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
3. Click "Add New Project" and import your repo
4. Click "Deploy"

That's it. Vercel gives you a live URL you can share with anyone.

**You just built and shipped something.**

When you pick extras during setup, they get added to your project's Claude guide. Open your project in Claude and tell it what you want to build. It already knows which features you selected and how to set them up.

### Blockchain & Data
